## Project - Floorplan Cost Calculator
A commandline c# calculator that calculates area of a floorplan and returns its cost. Application currently supports 3 pre-defined floorplans but can be generalised by:
- Accepting the number of rectangles, circles and triangles in the floorplan and their associated sizes to calculate the area.
- Accepting a user-defined cost per unit area when calculating the costs.
- Accepting a currency and calculating the cost in that currency.
- Any other extensions to the calculator based on the area as an input.
