3. For C# projects Open the file using Visual Studio and run `dotnet run`.
4. For c++ projects, download and install the g++ compiler from [Mingw.org](http://mingw.org/). Then add it your `PATH` envrionment variable via `control panel > Edit system envrionment variables` window. You can then compile c++ files from command line and run them as executables.
