## C# Project - Floorplan Cost Calculator

A commandline c# calculator that calculates area of a floorplan and returns its cost. Application currently supports 3 pre-defined floorplans but can be generalised by:

## C# Project - Creature Constructor

A command line c# application that prints ascii creatures by constructing their bodies on piece at the time. The body parts of the creatures can be pieced together randomly or be user-defined. If user does not define a body part, a random body part will be assigned to the creature before printing it.

## C++ Project - Quadratic Root Calculator

A command line c++ application that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Ali-Parandeh/csharp-projects.git`
2. `cd` into each project folder.
3. For C# projects Open the file using Visual Studio and run `dotnet run`.
4. For c++ projects, download and install the g++ compiler from [Mingw.org](http://mingw.org/). Then add it your `PATH` envrionment variable via `control panel > Edit system envrionment variables` window. You can then compile c++ files from command line and run them as executables.
